# shrink-ray

### Introduction

shrink-ray.pl looks through all the video files in the given directories and retranscodes them if it deems them too big.

### Caveats

I wrote it in around an hour and it suits my purposes, but I would not suggest you actually use it.  There may be giant
hairy bugs in it that delete all your files.  Only use it as inspiration (if at all).  

You have been warned.
